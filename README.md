Todo:
- PND over time
- Encounter duration
- Actual group mapping
- Semi artificial group mapping

Also:
- PND into util_plt
- Encounter metrics into util_plt


- Do mapping for actual 
- Do mapping for semi artificial groups 
- Adjust codes for Mapping instead of duplicated data frame
- Encounter Duration Code
- PND over time Code
- Put PND and Encounter calculations into utils
- Nearest Neighbour distance instead of PND
- Manual Speed calculation (distance over time)
- Curve fitting of PND over time
- Implement parallel processing where necessary (util function)
- Implement global tqdm feedback
- Think about cache use
- Create automated bash script pipeline
- Implement selecting conditions
- Create main with select plot
- Make colours consistent (mapping)
- Add info to plot (N/ stimulation/ light/ â€¦)
- CLEAN UP EVERYTHING
- VECTORISE EVERYTING
- Rerun TRex with different treshold
- Plot basic movement parameters over Pairwise neighbour distance
  - Point of fitted curves highest second derivation = Encounter Threshold
- Fill README.md file (make understandable for everybody)
